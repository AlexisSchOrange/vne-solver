# For edges, put all edges
# For nodes, put all nodes
# For other, put (a given number) of random greedy mappings
# For overlapping nodes, add (some other number) of greedy mappings, where the overlapping nodes are fixed

# Then, do some greedy heuristic with the dual costs


# And then, add the sub sn if needed (very large graphs)



# And finally, a clean CG.



# For medium size, only do the fast things.

# For one hour, have fun with the longer sub sn heuristics.
